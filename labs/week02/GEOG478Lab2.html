      <p> I'm a dedicated environmental studies major with a minor in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I want to make a positive impact on the world by bridging the gap between environmental conservation and cutting-edge technology.
        My journey began with a deep-rooted passion for our planet and the desire to protect it. Through my studies, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of environmental issues, from sustainability and conservation to climate change and ecology. I'm committed to using this knowledge to drive positive change.
        I thrive on collaboration and have had the privilege of working with diverse teams on projects that require innovative solutions. I believe in the power of data to drive informed decision-making. I'm well-versed in collecting, managing, and analyzing environmental data to develop sustainable strategies and policies.</p>
